Java Version
--------------------
1. This code is almost a direct translation of the C code
2. The Node class is instantiated 4 times within NetworkSimulator.java as opposed to having a file for each node (node1.c, ..., node4.c)
3. Some methods and variables are made public and static in NetworkSimulator.java to allow the Node class to access them
4. Students need to modify only Node.java. The code skeleton for that class is provided.
5. A Makefile is provided

Design
--------------------
See comments in node.java for questions on design and implementation
rinit() called in for every node after node is given name and lkcost
rinit initilizes relevant data structures and tables then figures out which nodes are neighbors and sends these neigbors distance vectors
rupdate will look at the costs table and the recieved min costs and evaluate if changes can be made to to said costs table based on distance vectors
if changes can be made they are and the min costs and and costs table are updated then this node will tell its neighbors something has changed
When sending distance vectors to a specific neighbor it checks to make sure that sending specific values does not result in loops via the send to fridns methods
The split horizon is implemented in this helper method and makes it so that the best distance form this node to destination via j contains no loops
In doing this the distance tables for nodes 0-3 are all perfectly matching the correct tables
Link handler basically updates the nodes link costs between neighbors resets the min costs and then also resets the costs table and resend vectors
In doing so even non altered nodes will recieve an update and change their costs tables accordingly

To see the result of running our DVR with trace 2 and random seed of some number look at DVRtraceout.txt
